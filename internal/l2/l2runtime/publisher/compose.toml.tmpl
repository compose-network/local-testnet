# Minimal registry configuration for Publisher
# This file prevents Publisher from loading embedded chain definitions
# L1 configuration provided via environment variables
# Chains defined via REGISTRY_STATIC_CHAIN_IDS environment variable

[l1]
# L1 config will be overridden by environment variables
# No additional configuration needed here

# No chains defined - using REGISTRY_STATIC_CHAIN_IDS instead
