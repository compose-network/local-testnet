## ✨ Introduction

Local testnet is a CLI tool for managing local L1 and L2 Ethereum test networks. It provides a complete local development environment for testing Ethereum applications with multiple L2 rollups.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Go 1.25+
- Kurtosis (for L1 network)
- Foundry/Forge (for L2 commands)
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) (for L2 commands)
- jq (for L2 commands)

## ⚙️  How to Build

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/compose-network/local-testnet.git

# Navigate
cd local-testnet

# Build the binary
make build
```

The binary will be available at `cmd/localnet/bin/localnet`.

## 🚀 Commands

The tool provides four main commands, each managing a different part of the local network:

### L1 Network (`localnet l1`)
Manages the Layer 1 Ethereum test network using Kurtosis. Deploys execution and consensus clients along with SSV nodes.

**📖 [Read L1 Documentation](internal/l1/README.md)**

### L2 Network (`localnet l2`)
Manages Layer 2 rollup networks. Orchestrates a three-phase deployment process for multiple OP Stack rollups.

**📖 [Read L2 Documentation](internal/l2/README.md)**

### Celestia Stack (`localnet celestia`)
Manages Celestia DA services used by Alt-DA mode, including Celestia app, bridge, op-alt-da, and optional Celenium services.
Runtime assets are generated under `.localnet/celestia`, and Celenium repositories are sourced from configured forks/tags.

### Observability (`localnet observability`)
Manages the observability stack for monitoring and debugging. Deploys Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, and Alloy.

**📖 [Read Observability Documentation](internal/observability/README.md)**

## 🔧 Usage

```bash
# Build and run (based on what's enabled in config.yaml)
make run

# Or run specific components:
make run-l1              # Start L1 network
make run-l2              # Start L2 networks
make run-celestia        # Start Celestia stack
make run-l2-compile      # Compile L2 contracts from publisher repo
make run-observability   # Start observability stack

# Inspect running services:
make show-l1             # Show Kurtosis enclave
make show-l2             # Show L2 docker containers
make show-celestia       # Show Celestia docker containers
make show-observability  # Show observability containers

# Stop services (preserves configs):
make stop                # Stop all components
make stop-l1             # Stop L1 (Kurtosis)
make stop-l2             # Stop L2 (Docker containers)
make stop-celestia       # Stop Celestia stack
make stop-observability  # Stop observability stack

# Clean up (removes configs):
make clean               # Clean all components
make clean-l1            # Clean L1 (Kurtosis)
make clean-l2            # Clean L2 (docker containers + generated files)
make clean-celestia      # Clean Celestia stack
make clean-observability # Clean observability stack
```

Configuration is managed via `configs/config.yaml`.

## 📜 Viewing Logs

Each component has its own logging approach:

- **L1**: Uses Kurtosis — see [L1 Documentation](internal/l1/README.md#viewing-logs)
- **L2**: Uses Docker containers — see [L2 Documentation](internal/l2/README.md#viewing-logs)
- **Celestia**: Uses generated Docker Compose assets in `.localnet/celestia`
- **Observability**: Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000 for dashboards and Loki log aggregation

## ⏹️ Stopping Services

```bash
# Stop all services (preserves configs and state)
make stop

# Or stop specific components:
make stop-l1              # Stop L1 (Kurtosis enclave)
make stop-l2              # Stop L2 (Docker containers)
make stop-celestia        # Stop Celestia stack
make stop-observability   # Stop observability stack
```

Use `make clean-*` commands for full cleanup (removes configs and volumes).

## 🐳 Docker Usage

The tool can be run in Docker, which is useful for CI/CD or environments where dependencies are difficult to install.
